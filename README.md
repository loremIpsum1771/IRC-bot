###### *The files in this repo are a part of an online [tutorial](http://newcoder.io/networks/intro/) that I went through in order to learn about networks.*

##### General Overview
* The tutorial is a walkthrough on how to make an Internet Relay Chat bot (IRC) within the [twisted framework](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)
* It covers testing, logging, as well as event-driven programming, different internet protocols, and making a portable application.
* The code within the project is based on [Jessamyn Smith's IRC Bot](https://github.com/jessamynsmith/talkbackbot)
